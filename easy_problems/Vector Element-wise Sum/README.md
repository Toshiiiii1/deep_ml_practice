## [Vector Element-wise Sum](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems/121) ![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

Write a Python function that computes the element-wise sum of two vectors. The function should return a new vector representing the resulting sum if the operation is valid, or -1 if the vectors have incompatible dimensions. Two vectors (lists) can be summed element-wise only if they are of the same length.

### Example:

**Input:**

```python
a = [1, 3], b = [4, 5]
```


**Output:**

```[5, 8]```
