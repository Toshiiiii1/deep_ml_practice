## [Detect Overfitting or Underfitting](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems/86) ![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

Write a Python function to determine whether a machine learning model is overfitting, underfitting, or performing well based on training and test accuracy values.

The function should take two inputs: `training_accuracy` and `test_accuracy`. It should return one of three values: 1 if Overfitting, -1 if Underfitting, or 0 if a Good fit. The rules for determination are as follows:

- Overfitting: The training accuracy is significantly higher than the test accuracy (difference > 0.2).

- Underfitting: Both training and test accuracy are below 0.7.

- Good fit: Neither of the above conditions is true.

### Example:

**Input:**

```python
training_accuracy = 0.95
test_accuracy = 0.65
```


**Output:**

```'1'```
