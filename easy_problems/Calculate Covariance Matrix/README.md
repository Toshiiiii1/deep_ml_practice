## [Calculate Covariance Matrix](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems/10) ![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

Write a Python function to calculate the covariance matrix for a given set of vectors. The function should take a list of lists, where each inner list represents a feature with its observations, and return a covariance matrix as a list of lists. Additionally, provide test cases to verify the correctness of your implementation.

### Example:

**Input:**

```[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]```


**Output:**

```[[1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0]]```
