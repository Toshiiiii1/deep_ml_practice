## [Implement the Swish Activation Function](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems/102) ![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

Implement the Swish activation function, a self-gated activation function that has shown superior performance in deep neural networks compared to ReLU. Your task is to compute the Swish value for a given input.

### Example:

**Input:**

```python
swish(1)
```


**Output:**

```0.7311```
