## [Min-Max Normalization of Feature Values](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems/112) ![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

Implement a function that performs Min-Max Normalization on a list of integers, scaling all values to the range [0, 1]. Min-Max normalization helps ensure that all features contribute equally to a model by scaling them to a common range.

### Example:

**Input:**

```python
min_max([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```


**Output:**

```bash
[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```
