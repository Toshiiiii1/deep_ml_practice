## [Bhattacharyya Distance Between Two Distributions](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems/120) ![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

Implement a function to calculate the Bhattacharyya distance between two probability distributions. The function should take two lists representing discrete probability distributions `p` and `q`, and return the Bhattacharyya distance rounded to 4 decimal places. If the inputs have different lengths or are empty, return 0.0.

### Example:

**Input:**

```python
p = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], q = [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]
```


**Output:**

```0.1166```
