## [Compute the Cross Product of Two 3D Vectors](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems/118) ![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

Implement a function to compute the cross product of two 3-dimensional vectors. The cross product of two vectors results in a third vector that is perpendicular to both and follows the right-hand rule. This concept is fundamental in physics, engineering, and 3D graphics.

### Example:

**Input:**

```python
cross_product([1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0])
```


**Output:**

```[0, 0, 1]```
