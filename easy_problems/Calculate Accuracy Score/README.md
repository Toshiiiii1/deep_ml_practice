## [Calculate Accuracy Score](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems/36) ![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

Write a Python function to calculate the accuracy score of a model's predictions. The function should take in two 1D numpy arrays: y_true, which contains the true labels, and y_pred, which contains the predicted labels. It should return the accuracy score as a float.

### Example:

**Input:**

```
y_true = np.array([1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1])
y_pred = np.array([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1])
```


**Output:**

```0.8333333333333334```
