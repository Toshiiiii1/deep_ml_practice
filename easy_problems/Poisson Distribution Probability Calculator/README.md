## [Poisson Distribution Probability Calculator](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems/81) ![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

Write a Python function to calculate the probability of observing exactly k events in a fixed interval using the Poisson distribution formula. The function should take k (number of events) and lam (mean rate of occurrences) as inputs and return the probability rounded to 5 decimal places.

### Example:

**Input:**

```python
k = 3, lam = 5
```


**Output:**

```0.14037```
