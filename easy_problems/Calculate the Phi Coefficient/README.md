## [Calculate the Phi Coefficient](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems/95) ![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

Implement a function to calculate the Phi coefficient, a measure of the correlation between two binary variables. The function should take two lists of integers (0s and 1s) as input and return the Phi coefficient rounded to 4 decimal places.

### Example:

**Input:**

```python
phi_corr([1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1])
```


**Output:**

```-1.0```
