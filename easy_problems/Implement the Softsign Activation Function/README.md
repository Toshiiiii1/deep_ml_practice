## [Implement the Softsign Activation Function](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems/100) ![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

Implement the Softsign activation function, a smooth activation function used in neural networks. Your task is to compute the Softsign value for a given input, ensuring the output is bounded between -1 and 1.

### Example:

**Input:**

```python
softsign(1)
```


**Output:**

```0.5```
