## [Calculate Mean Absolute Error (MAE)](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems/93) ![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

Implement a function to calculate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between two arrays of actual and predicted values. The MAE is a metric used to measure the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions without considering their direction.

### Example:

**Input:**

```python
y_true = np.array([3, -0.5, 2, 7])
y_pred = np.array([2.5, 0.0, 2, 8])
```


**Output:**

```0.500```
