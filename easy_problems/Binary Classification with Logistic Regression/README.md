## [Binary Classification with Logistic Regression](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems/104) ![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

Implement the prediction function for binary classification using Logistic Regression. Your task is to compute class probabilities using the sigmoid function and return binary predictions based on a threshold of 0.5.

### Example:

**Input:**

```python
predict_logistic(np.array([[1, 1], [2, 2], [-1, -1], [-2, -2]]), np.array([1, 1]), 0)
```


**Output:**

```[1 1 0 0]```
