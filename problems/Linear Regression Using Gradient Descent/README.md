## [Linear Regression Using Gradient Descent](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems/15) ![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

Write a Python function that performs linear regression using gradient descent. The function should take NumPy arrays X (features with a column of ones for the intercept) and y (target) as input, along with learning rate alpha and the number of iterations, and return the coefficients of the linear regression model as a NumPy array. Round your answer to four decimal places. -0.0 is a valid result for rounding a very small number.

### Example:

**Input:**

```
X = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]])
y = np.array([1, 2, 3])
alpha = 0.01
iterations = 1000
```


**Output:**

```np.array([0.1107, 0.9513])```
