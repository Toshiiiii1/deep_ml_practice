## [Linear Kernel Function](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems/45) ![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

Write a Python function kernel_function that computes the linear kernel between two input vectors x1 and x2. The linear kernel is defined as the dot product (inner product) of two vectors.

### Example:

**Input:**

```
x1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
x2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

result = kernel_function(x1, x2)
print(result)
```


**Output:**

```32```
