## [Linear Regression Using Normal Equation](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems/14) ![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

Write a Python function that performs linear regression using the normal equation. The function should take a matrix X (features) and a vector y (target) as input, and return the coefficients of the linear regression model. Round your answer to four decimal places, -0.0 is a valid result for rounding a very small number.

### Example:

**Input:**

```X = [[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]], y = [1, 2, 3]```


**Output:**

```[0.0, 1.0]```
