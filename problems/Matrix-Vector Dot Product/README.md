## [Matrix-Vector Dot Product](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems/1) ![Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

Write a Python function that computes the dot product of a matrix and a vector. The function should return a list representing the resulting vector if the operation is valid, or -1 if the matrix and vector dimensions are incompatible. A matrix (a list of lists) can be dotted with a vector (a list) only if the number of columns in the matrix equals the length of the vector. For example, an n x m matrix requires a vector of length m.

### Example:

**Input:**

```a = [[1, 2], [2, 4]], b = [1, 2]```


**Output:**

```[5, 10]```
