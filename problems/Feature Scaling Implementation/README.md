## [Feature Scaling Implementation](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems/16) ![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

Write a Python function that performs feature scaling on a dataset using both standardization and min-max normalization. The function should take a 2D NumPy array as input, where each row represents a data sample and each column represents a feature. It should return two 2D NumPy arrays: one scaled by standardization and one by min-max normalization. Make sure all results are rounded to the nearest 4th decimal.

### Example:

**Input:**

```data = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])```


**Output:**

```([[-1.2247, -1.2247], [0.0, 0.0], [1.2247, 1.2247]], [[0.0, 0.0], [0.5, 0.5], [1.0, 1.0]])```
