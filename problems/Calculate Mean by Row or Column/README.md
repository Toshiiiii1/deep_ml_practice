Write a Python function that calculates the mean of a matrix either by row or by column, based on a given mode. The function should take a matrix (list of lists) and a mode ('row' or 'column') as input and return a list of means according to the specified mode.

### Example:

**Input:**

```matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], mode = 'column'```


**Output:**

```[[4.0, 5.0, 6.0]```
