## [Implement Gini Impurity Calculation for a Set of Classes](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems/64) ![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

Your task is to implement a function that calculates the Gini Impurity for a set of classes. Gini impurity is commonly used in decision tree algorithms to measure the impurity or disorder within a node.

### Example:

**Input:**

```python
y = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
print(gini_impurity(y))
```


**Output:**

```0.48```
